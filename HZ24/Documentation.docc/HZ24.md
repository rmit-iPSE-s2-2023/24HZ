# ``HZ24``

Listen for new token releases or events about your favorite tokens on Zora. Stay up-to-date with what happens on your favorite network.  

## Overview

The _24HZ_ project builds an iOS app and a complementary widget using SwiftUI. The app allows a user to add ``Listener``(s), and display the captured ``Event``(s) on their feed. The widget displays the latest event to hint new information for the user at a glance.

This project utilizes the Model-View pattern. The Model consists of the **data layer** for managing Core Data entities, and the **network layer** for gathering information from the blockchain. The View consists of SwiftUI views that display the contents of the iOS app and widget. The current version of the app uses internal networking code as well as third-party abstractions for the network layer. For more details on networking code and its dependencies, see [Network Layer](#network-layer).

> The official name of the project is _24HZ_. However, "HZ24" may be displayed in some contexts to adhere to Xcode's restrictions, specifically complications with naming symbols with a non-alphabet character. Therefore, 24HZ and HZ24 can be used interchangeably when referring to this project.
