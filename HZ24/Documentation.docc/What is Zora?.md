# What is Zora?

An artist's paradise.

## Overview

Tired of the corporate overlords and their extractive business methods, the crypto world has seen major adoption amongsts progressive artists, searching for their own slice of paradise in the digital landscape. The ability to tokenize works on the blockchain enables artists to release their works to a global audience without the need of an array of middlemen and unforgiving platform restrictions. Ethereum has been the most popular blockchain for such artists in recent years. However, the fees to _deploy_ and _mint_ new works on-chain can be unpredictable and disproportianate, especially during busy periods. Thankfully, there is a silver lining! Layer 2 networks are emerging to solve some of these problems.

Layer 2 networks promise the security of a widely adopted blockchain, such as Ethereum, with the additional benefit of lowered transactional costs; meaning it is more feasible for any artist to release works (_deploy_ token contracts) and for fans to buy their works (_mint_ the tokens). _Zora_ is one of these efforts. Their branding resonates with the crypto art community and they provide native tooling such as the _ZDK_ and the _Zora Explorer_ to foster a strong developer ecosystem. This makes _Zora_ a strong contender in introducing blockchain to a whole new school of artists and their fans.
