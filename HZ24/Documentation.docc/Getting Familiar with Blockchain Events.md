There is always something happening on the blockchain.

## Overview

No matter what blockchain, there is always something happening. In the case of Zora, or any EVM-compatible blockchain, when a user interacts with the blockchain, an event is "logged". These events describe what _changed_ on the blockchain and can contain useful information, such as:
- who bought a new work and the comment they included,
- an update for a particular metadata related to an art collection, or
- information about a new collection of works deployed on-chain.

In sum, a blockchain event is just like any other event. The benefit of a **blockchain** event is that because the information about the event is recorded on-chain, it is verifiable and readable by anyone.
