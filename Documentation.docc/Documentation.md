Listen for new token releases or special events for your favorite tokens on Zora. Stay up-to-date with what happens on your favorite network.  

## Overview

24HZ contains networking code that gathers data from the blockchain and views to display useful information to the user. The blockchain data required for the app is described by the ``EventsProvider`` protocol. The current version of the app implements this protocol using both internal RPC HTTP calls and third-party abstractions to gather the data. These methods are combined and enscapsulated in the ``DefaultEventsProvider`` implementation.
